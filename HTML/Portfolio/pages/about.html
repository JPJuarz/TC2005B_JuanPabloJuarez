    <p id="me"> My name is Juan Pablo Juárez Ortiz, I am 20 years old from Mexico. I am currently studying Systems Engineering in the Instituto Tecnológico de Estudios Superiores de Monterrey (TEC). I have a passion for technology and programming and I am excited to learn more about software development and about the decision-making processes in this course. In my free time, I enjoy playing video games, watching movies, and spending time with friends and family. I also am looking forward to a great semester! </p>
